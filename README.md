Hello / Privet / Saluton! You could find some my publications (RU, EN) and presentations (RU) from conferences, where I was a speaker. I like gamedev (GGJ, JS 13k, and so on), DevOps (somewhat) and Python (I didn't link anything, cause my Python is so-so. But I am very passionate!). /me could write some code with Golang, PHP, C and Pascal (me somewhat old-fashioned). I have some background as DBA, and as a platform/cloud developer, so they are the domains, where I most effective.
